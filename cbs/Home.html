    <b> Ben Carson,</b> in full Benjamin Solomon Carson ,Sr.,
            [born september 18,1951,Detroit ,Michigan,U.S],American
             politician and neurosurgeon who performed the first 
             succesful separation of conjoined twins who were 
             attached at the back of the head [occipital craniopagus 
             twins].The operation ,who took place in 1987 ,lasted some 
             some 22hours and involved a 70 member surgical theme.
             Carson also refined a technique known as hemispherectomy,
             in which one half of the brain is removed to prevent 
             seizures in persons with severe epilepsy.He later became
              active in politics and served as U.S secretary .<mark style="background-color: blue;"> Carson 
              spent his childhood in Detroit</mark> .His parents divorced when 
              he was eight ,he and thereafter ,he lived with with his 
              mother and brother ,spending a brief period in Boston and 
              later returning to Detroit .Although Carson showed potential 
              as a student ,he performed poorly in school until his mother 
              challenged him and his brother with reading and writing 
              assignments in addition to their regular schoolwork. 
              Carson developed a new found interest in learning and 
              eventually earned a scholarship to Yale University ,receiving 
              a bachelor's degree in psychology .<q>In 1973.While at Yale 
              university</q> ,he met Lacena ["candy"]Rustin;the couple married 
              in 1975 and had three children.He next attended the university 
              of Michigan ,earning a medical degree in 1977 ,and later Johns 
              Hopkins university .Medical school in Baltimore ,Maryland ,where
               he completed a residency in neurosurgery .<i>In 1984,after a brief
                stint as a senior registrar in neurosurgery at the charles
                 Gairdner Hospital ,part of the queen Elizabeth ,medical 
                 center i Nedlands ,Western Australia ,Carson became director
                 of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins.He was one of the 
                 youngest doctors in the United States to earn such a title.</i> 
                 He later also held professorships in plastic surgery , 
                 oncology ,and pediatrics at John Hopkins .In his successful 
                 separation of occipital craniopagus twins in 1987,Carson 
                 used a radical<sup> approach in which the twins's body temperatures</sup> 
                 were lowered to the point of circulatory arrest.The success of 
                 the procedure and <sub>the reconsructive techniques employed gained</sub>
                Carson world renown as a pediatric neurosurgeon .In 1997,in a
                 28 hour long operation ,he led a team of South African and Zambian
